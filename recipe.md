#### DIRECTIONS
For the vegan bacon, slice the tofu into long 1-2 inch strips, in a non stick pan heat 1 tablespoon of oil over high heat, add the strips to the pan, lower the heat to medium, cook on both sides for 2-3 minutes until browned. Set aside in the fridge for 2-3 hours or overnight if time. This step will firm up the tofu and give it a great grizzly texture.

In a medium bowl whisk all the marinade ingredients and toss the tofu strips, coating well in the marinade. 

#### DIRECTIONS - BURGERS
Drain and rinse the beans and chickpeas. 

In a food processor add all the burger ingredients and blend until it all comes together and the cashews have been blended.

Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour. Empty the burger mixture out onto the surface and roll out into a thin layer around 1-2 cm high. To shape your burgers simply use a large scone cutter to cut out your burgers. Transfer the burgers to an airtight container, adding small sheets of parchment between the burgers to stop them sticking together. Freeze immediately and cook when needed.

To cook, heat 1Tbsp of oil over a high heat, add the burger to the pan, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 3-4  minutes per side, until nicely browned on each side and cooked through. Serve with your favourite toasted bun or lettuce cup and toppings. Enjoy!
